/** A block is an anonymous method defined within a method or another block.
 *  Ala gnu impl., blocks aren't stored en masse inline.
 *
 *  Blocks are tracked by enclosing method's {@link STCompiledBlock} object.
 *
 *  A method does not have a block that holds the locals. We mix the
 *  arguments and locals together to be consistent with blocks
 *  like [:x | |a b| ...] that have both arguments and locals.
 *
 *  Block/method symbols also keep a reference to an {@link STCompiledBlock}
 *  object that results from compilation. The VM collects these compiled
 *  blocks and creates {@link STMetaClassObject} objects for each
 *  {@link Symbol.ClassSymbol}.
 *
 *  In some sense, a block should subclass a method symbol instead of
 *  method subclassing block. But, method is somehow a "larger" concept
 *  than a block and can be seen as a specialization. As far as implementation,
 *  however, it would be better to have the block subclass the method to
 *  add the index field. That is how I originally had it but it got confusing
 *  from a usage point of view. For example, look at the name and argument type
 *  of this method:
 *
 *  STCompiledBlock getCompiledBlock(STMethod blk, ...)
 *
 *  Weird, right? Now, STBlock pretty much has all fields and I view a
 *  method as a block with a name.
