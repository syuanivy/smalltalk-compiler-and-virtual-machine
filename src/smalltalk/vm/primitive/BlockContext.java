/** "The interpreter uses contexts to represent the state of its execution of
 *   CompiledMethods and blocks. A context can be a MethodContext or a
 *   BlockContext. A MethodContext represents the execution of a
 *   CompiledMethod that was invoked by a message." --Bluebook, page 580.
 *   http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks/BlueBook/Bluebook.pdf
 *
 *  Like Pharo, but unlike the original Smalltalk, we use a single context
 *  object, BlockContext, to represent both block and method context. It's
 *  just simpler. Pharo uses MethodContext but we use BlockContext (after
 *  much deliberation!)
 *
 *  This object represents the execution of a {@link STCompiledBlock} in response
 *  to a message send. This context holds the locals (with arguments first)
 *  and operand stack for computation.  It knows where it is within the method
 *  code block (field ip) and what receiver it's executing the method for.
 *
 *  The VM does not have an explicit invocation stack. The implicit invocation
 *  stack follows the invokingContext chain upwards, just like we
 *  do when resolving symbols.
 *
 *  "A Little SmallTalk" uses Context and (poorly named) Interpreter objects
 *  to represent the execution context of a method. see pdf page 148.
 *  http://sdmeta.gforge.inria.fr/FreeBooks/LittleSmalltalk/ALittleSmalltalk.pdf
 *
 *  This object is not exposed to ST programs as an STObject, as is typical,
 *  for simplicity reasons.

	/*  The following two fields are used only by block executions.
	 *
	 *  "A BlockContext represents a block encountered in a CompiledMethod
	 *   [and evaluated]. A BlockContext refers to the MethodContext whose
	 *   CompiledMethod contained the block it represents." -- bluebook p 581 in pdf.
	 *  http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks/BlueBook/Bluebook.pdf
	 *
	 *  Because blocks are embedded within methods/blocks, this
	 *  object knows which block or method surrounds it and
	 *  also knows the outermost surrounding context: the surrounding
	 *  method. For example, the following method has two embedded
	 *  blocks.
	 *
	 *  foo [
	 *     [ "block 1 starts"
	 *        [^99 "block 2"] value
	 *     ] value
	 *  ]
	 *
	 *  The outermost context is the BlockContext we create for foo when
	 *  it's invoked. Block [[^99] value] has both enclosingContext and
	 *  enclosingMethodContext (both point at the foo context). The
	 *  innermost block, [^99], has:
	 *  	1.  enclosingContext pointing at the (block) BlockContext created
	 *         	during evaluation of block [[^99] value]
	 *      2.  enclosingMethodContext pointing at the foo BlockContext
	 *
	 *  A (block) context object is created from a {@link BlockDescriptor}
	 *  when we hit it with a "value" message to evaluate itself.

	 *  block associated with this context is defined.  We need to locate
	 *  the method context that created us so that we can return properly
	 *  upon METHOD_RETURN bytecode. To perform a return, we unwind the
	 *  stack until we reach one level above enclosingMethodContext and
	 *  then push the return result on that context's stack.
	 *
	 *  Smalltalk code can also create a block and pass it as

	 *  created the block and then return from it.  Moreover, if
	 *  the enclosingMethodContext has returned when this block
	 *  tries to return, we still a pointer to the method so we
	 *  can respond appropriately with an error.
